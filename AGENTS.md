## Project Overview

**Netscope** is a desktop app for viewing and analyzing HTTP Archive (HAR) files, available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It provides a Chrome DevTools-like network inspection experience as a standalone app. Built with Electron 41, React 19, TypeScript 6, and Vite 5.

- **Package name:** `netscope`
- **App ID:** `com.netscope.app`
- **Repository:** https://github.com/Dru89/netscope
- **License:** MIT

## Architecture

Netscope is an Electron app with three process layers:

1. **Main process** (`electron/main.ts`) -- Node.js runtime handling window management, file I/O, native menus, file associations (macOS Finder, command-line args on all platforms), theme detection, and auto-updates (`electron-updater`). Manages multiple windows via a `Set<BrowserWindow>` and tracks loaded files in a `Map<BrowserWindow, string>`. Platform-specific behavior (title bar style, app menu, quit-on-close) is guarded by an `isMac` constant.

2. **Preload script** (`electron/preload.ts`) -- Bridge layer using `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` to expose a typed `window.electronAPI` with 6 methods. This is the only communication channel between main and renderer.

3. **Renderer** (`src/`) -- A React 18 SPA bundled by Vite. No direct Node.js access. All file I/O goes through IPC. State is managed entirely with React hooks in `App.tsx` (no external state library). Falls back to browser `FileReader` when `window.electronAPI` is unavailable (dev mode).

Detailed architecture docs are in `docs/architecture.md`.

**Build outputs (all git-ignored):** `dist/` (Vite output), `dist-electron/` (bundled main/preload), `release/` (electron-builder .app/.dmg/.zip).

## Code Conventions

- **Components:** Named function exports in PascalCase files. Props interfaces defined inline at the top of each file. Sub-components may be co-located in the same file (e.g., `DetailPanel.tsx` contains 7 components for the panel and its tabs). `Toolbar.tsx` and `FilterInput.tsx` accept a `ref` prop for external focus control.
- **Types:** HAR spec types prefixed with `Har` (e.g., `HarEntry`, `HarRequest`). App types unprefixed (`FilterState`, `SortState`). Computed/internal fields prefixed with underscore (`_index`, `_url`, `_transferSize`).
- **Imports:** Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports. A `@/` path alias is configured but not currently used -- existing code uses relative paths.
- **Styling:** Plain CSS with BEM-like class names. Theme via CSS custom properties in `:root` and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. No CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, or Tailwind. Color variables follow `--color-{category}-{variant}` naming.
- **State management:** All state in `App.tsx` via `useState`/`useCallback`/`useMemo`, passed down as props. Theme preference persisted to `localStorage` key `themeMode`.
- **IPC pattern:** `ipcMain.handle` for renderer-to-main requests; `webContents.send` + `ipcRenderer.on` for main-to-renderer pushes. All listeners return unsubscribe functions for React `useEffect` cleanup.
- **No default exports** except `App.tsx`.

## Key Commands

```bash
make dev              # Vite dev server + Electron with hot reload
make build            # tsc && vite build (bundle only, no packaging)
make package          # Full production build: tsc && vite build && electron-builder
make test             # Run tests with Vitest (single run)
make test-watch       # Run tests in watch mode
make lint             # Type-check only (tsc --noEmit)
make clean            # Remove dist/, dist-electron/, release/
make icons            # Regenerate platform icons from images/netscope.png
make release          # Interactive version bump, tag, push (CI builds the release)
make site-dev         # Astro dev server for the marketing site
make site-build       # Build the marketing site
```

All targets are also available as npm scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm test`, etc.) except `make lint`, `make clean`, `make icons`, and `make release` which are Makefile-only.

## Testing

Tests use **Vitest** (configured automatically through the Vite config). Test files live alongside the source files they test, using the `.test.ts` suffix.

```
src/utils/filterParser.test.ts       # Filter parser and matcher unit tests (54 tests)
src/utils/filterSuggestions.test.ts  # Autocomplete suggestion logic tests (24 tests)
```

Run `npm test` before committing to make sure nothing is broken. When adding new utility functions, write tests. Component tests are not set up yet (no jsdom/happy-dom environment or React Testing Library).

### Writing Tests

- Test files go next to the source file: `foo.ts` -> `foo.test.ts`
- Use `describe`/`it`/`expect` from Vitest
- For testing against HAR entries, build minimal fakes with just the fields your test needs (see `makeEntry()` helper in `filterParser.test.ts` for the pattern)
- No HAR fixture files are needed for unit tests -- construct data inline

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The app supports keyboard navigation, implemented across `RequestTable.tsx` (table-scoped) and `App.tsx` (global document listener).

### Table-scoped (when request table has focus)

| Shortcut       | Action                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Up / k         | Select previous entry                  |
| Down / j       | Select next entry                      |
| Cmd+Up / Home  | Select first entry                     |
| Cmd+Down / End | Select last entry                      |
| Enter / Space  | Toggle detail panel for selected entry |

### Global

| Shortcut | Action                                                                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cmd+N    | Open a new empty window                                                           |
| Cmd+O    | Open file -- loads in place on welcome screen, opens new window if file is loaded |
| Escape   | Close detail panel and return focus to table; blur filter input                   |
| /        | Focus the toolbar filter input                                                    |
| Cmd+F    | Focus the toolbar filter (unless focus is in the detail panel)                    |

**Focus model:** The table container (`div.request-table-container`) has `tabIndex={0}` and handles its own `onKeyDown`. When focus moves elsewhere (detail panel, filter input), table shortcuts stop firing. This is intentional -- arrow keys in the detail panel scroll content, not the entry list. Escape returns focus to the table.

**Gotcha with Escape:** When Escape is pressed inside an input within the detail panel (e.g., the Source tab search input), the global handler defers to the detail panel's own Escape handling. Only a second Escape (or Escape from a non-input element) closes the panel.

## Multi-Window Behavior

The app supports multiple windows. New windows cascade 28px down and right from the focused window so title bars remain visible.

### Opening files

- **Cmd+O on welcome screen:** Loads the file in the current window.
- **Cmd+O with a file already loaded:** Opens the file in a new window (or focuses an existing window if that file is already open).
- **Drag and drop into a window:** Always replaces the current file in that window.
- **Finder double-click / dock icon drop:** Routes through `openFileInNewWindow`, which deduplicates by file path, reuses an empty welcome-screen window, or creates a new window.

### Window titles

Every file-open code path sets `win.setTitle(fileName)` and `win.setRepresentedFilename(resolved)` (macOS). The title isn't visible in the window chrome (due to `hiddenInset` title bar style) but appears in Mission Control, the Window menu, and Cmd-Tab.

### Recent files

The File > Open Recent submenu is built from an in-memory `recentDocuments` array (capped at 10). Each file-open path calls `addRecentDocument()` which updates both the array and the OS-level recent documents list (via `app.addRecentDocument()`, for the dock right-click menu). The app menu is rebuilt after each change. Missing files are removed from the array when detected and trigger a native warning dialog.

### Error handling

- **File not found (from Open Recent or dock):** Native warning dialog on the focused window. No new window is created. Stale entry is removed from the recent files list.
- **File not found (from `sendFileToWindow`):** Native warning dialog on the target window. Window state is unchanged.
- **Invalid HAR content:** Error message displayed on the welcome screen in the renderer (existing behavior).

## Filter Syntax

The toolbar search input supports Chrome DevTools-style structured filters via `src/utils/filterParser.ts`. The parser (`parseFilterQuery`) tokenizes the input and the matcher (`matchEntry`) tests entries against all tokens.

### Supported filters

| Filter                 | Example                        | What it matches                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| (plain text)           | `api`                          | URL or entry name substring                 |
| `domain:`              | `domain:*.example.com`         | Request domain (wildcard supported)         |
| `method:`              | `method:POST`                  | HTTP method                                 |
| `status-code:`         | `status-code:4xx`              | Status code (exact or range like `4xx`)     |
| `mime-type:`           | `mime-type:json`               | Response MIME type substring                |
| `larger-than:`         | `larger-than:1k`               | Transfer size threshold (supports `k`, `M`) |
| `scheme:`              | `scheme:https`                 | URL scheme                                  |
| `has-response-header:` | `has-response-header:x-custom` | Presence of a response header               |
| `url:`                 | `url:/api/v2`                  | URL substring (explicit)                    |

- Multiple filters are AND'd together
- Prefix any filter with `-` to negate it: `-domain:analytics.com`
- Quoted values supported: `domain:"my site.com"`
- Toolbar button filters (content type, method, status) are separate and AND'd with the text filters

### How it fits together

`App.tsx` parses `filter.search` into tokens with `useMemo`, then in the `filteredEntries` computation, calls `matchEntry(tokens, entry)` before applying the toolbar button filters. The old substring-only search is fully replaced by the parser -- plain text tokens produce the same behavior as before.

### Autocomplete

The filter input (`FilterInput.tsx`) provides autocomplete suggestions as you type. The suggestion logic lives in `src/utils/filterSuggestions.ts`:

- **Key suggestions:** When typing at the start of a token (no colon yet), the dropdown shows matching filter type names (e.g., typing `do` suggests `domain:`).
- **Value suggestions:** After typing a filter key and colon (e.g., `method:`), the dropdown shows actual values extracted from the loaded HAR data -- unique domains, methods, status codes, MIME types, schemes, and response header names. These are precomputed by `extractSuggestionData()` in a `useMemo` in `App.tsx` and passed to the Toolbar as `suggestionData`.
- **Keyboard interaction:** Arrow keys navigate suggestions, Enter/Tab accepts the selected suggestion, Escape dismisses the dropdown. When the dropdown is open, these keys are intercepted by the FilterInput and don't propagate to the table or global handlers.
- `larger-than:` and `url:` don't offer value suggestions (they're freeform).

## Architecture Decisions / Patterns to Preserve

- **No external state library.** All state lives in `App.tsx` and flows down as props. Don't introduce Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc. without good reason.
- **No virtualization.** The request table renders all rows as real DOM elements. This is fine for typical HAR files (hundreds to low thousands of entries). If performance becomes an issue with very large files, virtualization would be the right fix, but it adds complexity to keyboard navigation and scroll-into-view logic.
- **Pure utilities for testability.** Business logic that can be tested without React (parsing, filtering, formatting) belongs in `src/utils/` as pure functions. Keep components thin.
- **CSS custom properties for theming.** All colors go through `--color-*` variables defined in `global.css`. Don't use hardcoded color values in component styles.

## Release Process

Releases are built and published by **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). The workflow triggers on version tags (`v*`) and runs a matrix build across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### How to release

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` and run `npm install --package-lock-only` to sync the lockfile
2. Commit: `git commit -am "Bump version to X.Y.Z"`
3. Run `npm run release` (or manually: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`)
4. GitHub Actions builds, signs (macOS), notarizes (macOS), and uploads to GitHub Releases

### What the workflow does

1. Runs `npm test` on Ubuntu
2. Builds on three runners in parallel:
   - **macOS** (`macos-latest`) -- imports the signing certificate from secrets, builds DMG + ZIP (arm64 and x64), notarizes with Apple, publishes
   - **Windows** (`windows-latest`) -- builds NSIS installer (unsigned), publishes
   - **Linux** (`ubuntu-latest`) -- builds AppImage + .deb, publishes
3. electron-builder uploads all artifacts and `latest-*.yml` manifests to the same GitHub Release

### Required GitHub Actions secrets

| Secret                        | Purpose                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`      | Base64-encoded .p12 Developer ID certificate |
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`    | Password for the .p12 file                   |
| `APPLE_ID`                    | Apple ID email for notarization              |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for notarization       |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`               | Apple Developer Team ID                      |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by Actions. If any macOS secrets are missing, the build still succeeds but produces unsigned/un-notarized artifacts.

### Auto-updates

`electron-updater` is configured with the `github` provider. On each platform, it looks for the matching `latest-*.yml` manifest in GitHub Releases and downloads updates silently. Updates install on next app quit. No additional server or update feed is needed.

## App Icon

The source icon is `images/netscope.png` (2048x2048 RGBA). Platform-specific icons in `build/`:

- `icon.icns` -- macOS (generated with `sips` + `iconutil`)
- `icon.ico` -- Windows (generated with ImageMagick: `magick images/netscope.png -resize 256x256 -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 build/icon.ico`)
- `icon.png` -- Linux (512x512, generated with `sips -z 512 512`)

Site favicons in `site/public/` are also derived from the source image. If the icon changes, regenerate all derived files.

## Important Notes

- The app builds for **macOS 12+** (arm64 + x64), **Windows 10+** (x64, NSIS installer), and **Linux** (x64, AppImage + deb).
- Windows builds are unsigned -- users will see SmartScreen warnings on first run.
- `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false` -- the renderer cannot access Node.js APIs directly.
- The marketing site is a separate Astro project in `site/`, deployed to Netlify (configured in `netlify.toml` at the repo root).
- When bumping versions, update `version` in `package.json` and run `npm install --package-lock-only` to sync `package-lock.json`.
- **Do not bump the version in `package.json` as part of code change commits.** Version bumps are handled exclusively through `make release VERSION=<patch|minor|major>`, which bumps, commits, tags, and pushes in one step. Keep code changes and version bumps in separate commits.

## Keeping This File Up to Date
